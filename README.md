ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @johannafur and I'm finishing my MA in Intermedia Art (a.k.a. Mixed Media art). My aim is to work in the creative industry and open my own design store.

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web design, WebVR and 3D modelling. I'm also very enthusiastic about design in general (eg. interior design, graphic design).

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and various 3D modelling softwares.
